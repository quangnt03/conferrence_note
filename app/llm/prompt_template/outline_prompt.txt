Task: Topic Modeling and Outline Generation

Goal: Analyze the transcript to identify the main topics and their relative importance and create a detailed outline with headings and Subheadings, including a section for Q&A.

Input: {transcript}

Steps:
1. Generate a concise, informative title for the transcript that captures its core subject or purpose.

2. Use the topic modeling Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to identify the key topics covered in the speech. 

3. Determine what proportion of the speech was devoted to each main topic to gauge their relative importance in percentages.

4. Extract relevant keywords for each identified topic.

5. Based on the topics and keywords, create a structured outline with clear headings and subheadings. The outline should cover:
    - Major decisions made
    - Strategies discussed  
    - Key data points
    - Planned initiatives and next steps

6. Dedicate a separate section in the outline for Q&A:
    - Identify the main themes or topics addressed in the Q&A portion
    - Highlight any significant new information, insights, or decisions that emerged from the Q&A

7. Format the outline using markdown, with main topics as headings, subtopics as subheadings, and the Q&A section clearly delineated.
